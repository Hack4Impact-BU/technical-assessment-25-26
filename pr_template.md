## Requirements
Please check off which features you have implemented:
- [x] A catchy name and title with a cool font!
- [x] An interactive, pretty world map that spans most of the home page, using the [React Leaflet](https://react-leaflet.js.org/) library.
- [x] An [event](https://react-leaflet.js.org/docs/example-events/) that places a marker at your current location with a popup that displays the sunrise and sunset times of your location using the [Sunrise Sunset JS](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sunrise-sunset-js) library.
- [x] The popup should also display information about a place in a totally different part of the world with similar sunrise and sunset times. You should use the Google Gemini API for this, leveraging both system instructions and your individual queries to get the best result possible.
- [ ] A separate history page that keeps track of locations you've tapped. This should include latitude, longitude, and some information about Google Gemini's response. You can include the whole response if you want, but making another call to Google Gemini to extract just the location to put on there would be extra cool! You can display this information in whatever format you want. Make sure you can get between your home and history pages by clicking on an icon, text, etc.
- [x] Deploy the frontend and backend if you can using some of the free deployment tools we talked about in the workshops!

## Written Portion
1. **How did the project go? What parts of it did you most enjoy / find yourself good at?**

- The project's progress was faster than expected for the first steps. I didn't realize how expansive and easy to use js libraries were. They were enjoyable to learn. It was tricky integrating the api call especially onto the popup but not really that bad. The design part was simple but fun.
2. **Was this technical assessment what you expected? If you had another two weeks to work on it, what would you add or change?**

   There was more instructions than I anticipated but it felt fairly clear. What I really wish I could have adde dwas the history. Given more time I would have made separate pages. Of course, the history page is not included in this, which I wish I added. The popup idea was cool, but I would have perfered a separate place where times could be given by the user to then recieve countries.
