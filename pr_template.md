## Requirements
Please check off which features you have implemented:
- [x] A catchy name and title with a cool font!
- [x] An interactive, pretty world map that spans most of the home page, using the [React Leaflet](https://react-leaflet.js.org/) library.
- [x] An [event](https://react-leaflet.js.org/docs/example-events/) that places a marker at your current location with a popup that displays the sunrise and sunset times of your location using the [Sunrise Sunset JS](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sunrise-sunset-js) library.
- [x] The popup should also display information about a place in a totally different part of the world with similar sunrise and sunset times. You should use the Google Gemini API for this, leveraging both system instructions and your individual queries to get the best result possible.
- [x] A separate history page that keeps track of locations you've tapped. This should include latitude, longitude, and some information about Google Gemini's response. You can include the whole response if you want, but making another call to Google Gemini to extract just the location to put on there would be extra cool! You can display this information in whatever format you want. Make sure you can get between your home and history pages by clicking on an icon, text, etc.
- [x] Deploy the frontend and backend if you can using some of the free deployment tools we talked about in the workshops!

## Written Portion
1. **How did the project go? What parts of it did you most enjoy / find yourself good at?**

[I thought the project was overall enjoyable in learning how to code a full stack web application. I thought that slowly progressing the backend was cool to see overtime. Starting with the simple sunsetsunrise.js functiions for lat and lon to the entire backend comeplete. Styling the web application was also enjoyable. ]

2. **Was this technical assessment what you expected? If you had another two weeks to work on it, what would you add or change?**

[At first I did not think it was as much, but I did have to work on some backend requests for extended time. Specifically, training the gemini response to what I felt was good took some time. If I had two more weeks to work on this project, I would add more features to the website. I would add a search bar to search cities on the map and even the history page. In addition I would add a feature that allows the use to favorite certain places. Lastly, I think the website would benefit from mobile optimatization allowing users to access the website on mobile devices without any troubles. ]
