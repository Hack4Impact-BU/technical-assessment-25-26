## Requirements
Please check off which features you have implemented:
- [x] A catchy name and title with a cool font!
- [x] An interactive, pretty world map that spans most of the home page, using the [React Leaflet](https://react-leaflet.js.org/) library.
- [x] An [event](https://react-leaflet.js.org/docs/example-events/) that places a marker at your current location with a popup that displays the sunrise and sunset times of your location using the [Sunrise Sunset JS](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sunrise-sunset-js) library.
- [x] The popup should also display information about a place in a totally different part of the world with similar sunrise and sunset times. You should use the Google Gemini API for this, leveraging both system instructions and your individual queries to get the best result possible.
- [ ] A separate history page that keeps track of locations you've tapped. This should include latitude, longitude, and some information about Google Gemini's response. You can include the whole response if you want, but making another call to Google Gemini to extract just the location to put on there would be extra cool! You can display this information in whatever format you want. Make sure you can get between your home and history pages by clicking on an icon, text, etc.
- [ ] Deploy the frontend and backend if you can using some of the free deployment tools we talked about in the workshops!

## Written Portion
1. **How did the project go? What parts of it did you most enjoy / find yourself good at?**

[The Project was more difficult than i anticipated. I enjoyed learning how to use the react leaflet library and further strengthing my understanding of API implementation but i struggled immensly with mongoDB and at first I struggled with backend and its relevant server connections.I enjoyed seeing the live map constatnly update with markers in the website]

2. **Was this technical assessment what you expected? If you had another two weeks to work on it, what would you add or change?**

[It was not entirely what i expected but i figured i would be required to develop a website and show my proficiency with what we went over in the jdt-workshops although it was a neat surpirse to see we would have to learn a new API skill (leaflet). These past few weeks ive been very busy with my CGS Capstone and life (i got sick) so if i had more time i would focus on making the UI more user friendly and with more user feedback such as hover. I would also work to get my history page to work as i was struggling with mongodb and saving to the database. Something i would add to the website would also try to pull images of sensets from the area from the internet.]
