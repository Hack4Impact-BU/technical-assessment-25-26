## Requirements
Please check off which features you have implemented:
- [ ] A catchy name and title with a cool font!
- [ ] An interactive, pretty world map that spans most of the home page, using the [React Leaflet](https://react-leaflet.js.org/) library.
- [ ] An [event](https://react-leaflet.js.org/docs/example-events/) that places a marker at your current location with a popup that displays the sunrise and sunset times of your location using the [Sunrise Sunset JS](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sunrise-sunset-js) library.
- [ ] The popup should also display information about a place in a totally different part of the world with similar sunrise and sunset times. You should use the Google Gemini API for this, leveraging both system instructions and your individual queries to get the best result possible.
- [ ] A separate history page that keeps track of locations you've tapped. This should include latitude, longitude, and some information about Google Gemini's response. You can include the whole response if you want, but making another call to Google Gemini to extract just the location to put on there would be extra cool! You can display this information in whatever format you want. Make sure you can get between your home and history pages by clicking on an icon, text, etc.
- [ ] Deploy the frontend and backend if you can using some of the free deployment tools we talked about in the workshops!

## Written Portion
1. **How did the project go? What parts of it did you most enjoy / find yourself good at?**
[answer here]
This project was a good for developing and practicing SWE coding of an app while still being engaging for me throughout. It was a fairly simple prompt that you could dice further into and i enjoyed it. I enjoyed mesing around with the google geminni prompt the most and am happy with my end product. I struggled intially with the concepts and code for intial website/app setup but got the hang more as i got further along.


2. **Was this technical assessment what you expected? If you had another two weeks to work on it, what would you add or change?**

This technical assessment was a good difficulty and i felt was a good test. If i had more time i would make use my ai to use the coordinates and give a name of a main location in the form near(location). I would also try to do the thing where even though they are seperate, have the history gemini say the same lcoation but breifer when compared to the one in the popup.
