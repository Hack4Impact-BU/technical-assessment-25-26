## Requirements
Please check off which features you have implemented:
- X A catchy name and title with a cool font!
- X An interactive, pretty world map that spans most of the home page, using the [React Leaflet](https://react-leaflet.js.org/) library.
- X An [event](https://react-leaflet.js.org/docs/example-events/) that places a marker at your current location with a popup that displays the sunrise and sunset times of your location using the [Sunrise Sunset JS](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sunrise-sunset-js) library.
- X The popup should also display information about a place in a totally different part of the world with similar sunrise and sunset times. You should use the Google Gemini API for this, leveraging both system instructions and your individual queries to get the best result possible.
- X A separate history page that keeps track of locations you've tapped. This should include latitude, longitude, and some information about Google Gemini's response. You can include the whole response if you want, but making another call to Google Gemini to extract just the location to put on there would be extra cool! You can display this information in whatever format you want. Make sure you can get between your home and history pages by clicking on an icon, text, etc.
- X Deploy the frontend and backend if you can using some of the free deployment tools we talked about in the workshops!

Note: Frontend and Backend are set up, however, Heroku is giving build errors. I plan on fixing this issue even after the assessment deadline, as I am intrested to learning what it takes to deploy a full-stack website.

## Written Portion
1. **How did the project go? What parts of it did you most enjoy / find yourself good at?**

I think the project went very well. However I do wish I started working with Material UI from the start, becasue the implemenation for the front-end had become the hardest part of the project. I found myself working best and most enjoyed working in the backend. I've always loved systems and how to make connections between different systems. So if I had the honor to participate in the Impact team, I would love to devlop my skills further to help others!

2. **Was this technical assessment what you expected? If you had another two weeks to work on it, what would you add or change?**

This technical assessment is complex but fair. This assessment is more about knowing how to learn rather than using what we learned in the workshops and apply it to this project. I think this is a great technical assessment because it causes the testee to think detail-oriented to ensure a good product. It's very similar to how real software engineering is done, and I can't wait to do more! If I had more time, I would honestly scrap the entire project and build it again from the ground up. I realize that many systems I built weren't thought of as a component of a greater system, which is what eventually caused many issues later in devlopment. This opportunity has given me great insight on what it means to be a full-stack web devloper and built a passion to devlop my skills further. Thank you for the opportunity!
