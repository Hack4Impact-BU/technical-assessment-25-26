## Requirements
Please check off which features you have implemented:
- [x] A catchy name and title with a cool font!
- [x] An interactive, pretty world map that spans most of the home page, using the [React Leaflet](https://react-leaflet.js.org/) library.
- [x] An [event](https://react-leaflet.js.org/docs/example-events/) that places a marker at your current location with a popup that displays the sunrise and sunset times of your location using the [Sunrise Sunset JS](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sunrise-sunset-js) library.
- [x] The popup should also display information about a place in a totally different part of the world with similar sunrise and sunset times. You should use the Google Gemini API for this, leveraging both system instructions and your individual queries to get the best result possible.
- [x] A separate history page that keeps track of locations you've tapped. This should include latitude, longitude, and some information about Google Gemini's response. You can include the whole response if you want, but making another call to Google Gemini to extract just the location to put on there would be extra cool! You can display this information in whatever format you want. Make sure you can get between your home and history pages by clicking on an icon, text, etc.
- [x] Deploy the frontend and backend if you can using some of the free deployment tools we talked about in the workshops!

## Written Portion
1. **How did the project go? What parts of it did you most enjoy / find yourself good at?**

The project went smoothly. I enjoyed imlenting the data base the most.

2. **Was this technical assessment what you expected? If you had another two weeks to work on it, what would you add or change?**

To be honest I didn't quite know what to expect. I did love the promt though. I really liked the idea. If I had another two weeks, I would add a feature that would give the location for each click, and make the database feature more secure. I want the history to be held by cookies.
