## Requirements
Please check off which features you have implemented:
- [✓ ] A catchy name and title with a cool font!
- [ ✓] An interactive, pretty world map that spans most of the home page, using the [React Leaflet](https://react-leaflet.js.org/) library.
- [✓] An [event](https://react-leaflet.js.org/docs/example-events/) that places a marker at your current location with a popup that displays the sunrise and sunset times of your location using the [Sunrise Sunset JS](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sunrise-sunset-js) library.
- [✓] The popup should also display information about a place in a totally different part of the world with similar sunrise and sunset times. You should use the Google Gemini API for this, leveraging both system instructions and your individual queries to get the best result possible.
- [✓] A separate history page that keeps track of locations you've tapped. This should include latitude, longitude, and some information about Google Gemini's response. You can include the whole response if you want, but making another call to Google Gemini to extract just the location to put on there would be extra cool! You can display this information in whatever format you want. Make sure you can get between your home and history pages by clicking on an icon, text, etc.
- [✓] Deploy the frontend and backend if you can using some of the free deployment tools we talked about in the workshops!

## Written Portion
1. **How did the project go? What parts of it did you most enjoy / find yourself good at?**
   I think overall, I was very happy with my project and will probably continue to update it in the future. I  really enjoyed using the leaflet map and I'm excited to use it in future projects as well. I also enjoyed working on the frontend components as well. I'm currently taking CS391 web dev and we have learned react and next.js and this project allowed me to use those skills in conjunction with the skills I learned from the JDT workshops.

When working on this project, I utilized console logs heavily to debug. I was implementing a lot of features and processes for the first time so I wasn’t super knowledgeable about certain types, etc and the console logs helped me figure out what was being returned and in what form.


2. **Was this technical assessment what you expected? If you had another two weeks to work on it, what would you add or change?**

   I think this technical assessment was what I expected it to be. I think my currenct CS classes helped me a lot and if i hadn't taken a class on web dev before, I definitely would have been much more lost and confused. But I agree with statements from the original README about how important it is to be able to research a new tool, read documentation, implement it in your project, and then debug it. 

If I had 2 more weeks to work on this project I would want to implement an image database of sunset and sunrise images based on location. This way, after each marker is placed by the user, an image of the sunrise and sunset would be available to view. Furthermore, I would want to redo this project using Next.js and typescript. My recent assignments have been in Next.js and I would love to practice it more.
